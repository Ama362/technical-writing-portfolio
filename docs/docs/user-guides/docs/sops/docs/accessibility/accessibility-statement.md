Accessibility Statement for AccessTravel
Our Commitment to Accessibility
AccessTravel is committed to making travel planning accessible and inclusive for everyone, including people with disabilities and access needs. Accessibility is central to our mission, and we design our platform to support travelers with a wide range of mobility, visual, hearing, cognitive, and sensory requirements.
We recognize that accessibility is an ongoing process, and we are continuously working to improve the usability and inclusiveness of our platform.


Scope of This Accessibility Statement
This accessibility statement applies to the AccessTravel web application and its core features, including:
* User registration and accessibility profile setup
* Search and filtering of accommodations, attractions, restaurants, and transportation
* Accessibility-focused reviews and community content
* Trip planning tools and resource library
Some third-party content or services integrated into the platform may not be fully accessible and are outside our direct control.


Accessibility Standards
AccessTravel is designed to conform to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1, Level AA, which are internationally recognized standards for web accessibility.
These guidelines focus on making content:
* Perceivable: Information can be seen, heard, or otherwise perceived
* Operable: Users can navigate and interact using different input methods
* Understandable: Content and interactions are clear and predictable
* Robust: Content works with assistive technologies and different devices
Accessibility Features
The AccessTravel platform includes the following accessibility features:
* Keyboard navigation support for core functionality
* Semantic HTML and structured headings to improve screen reader navigation
* Text alternatives for images where appropriate, including accessibility-related photos
* Clear labels and instructions for forms, including accessibility profile inputs
* Visible focus indicators to help users navigate without a mouse
* High-contrast text and interface elements where supported
* Consistent layout and navigation patterns to reduce cognitive load
We design features with assistive technologies such as screen readers and keyboard-only navigation in mind.


User-Generated Content
AccessTravel includes community-contributed reviews, photos, and descriptions. While we provide guidelines and structured prompts to encourage accessible content, we cannot guarantee that all user-generated content meets accessibility standards.
We continuously work to improve tools and guidance that help contributors share accessibility information clearly and responsibly.


Known Limitations
Despite our efforts, some accessibility limitations may exist, including:
* Variations in accessibility quality of user-uploaded images and videos
* Incomplete accessibility data for some locations due to limited community verification
* Accessibility limitations in third-party maps, transportation data, or external services
We actively monitor these areas and prioritize improvements based on user feedback.

## About Me

I am a **Technical Writer** with **2 years of experience** creating clear and well-structured documentation for technical and non-technical audiences.

I focus on:
- Product documentation with SSGs
- User guides/ manual
- Technical and documentation-style articles
- Internal documents such as memos, eemails, proposals, complaiance policies etc
- Accessibility statements

I enjoy translating complex information into content that is easy to understand, accessible, and useful for end users and stakeholders.

## About Me

I am a **Technical Writer** with **2 years of experience** creating clear and well-structured documentation for technical and non-technical audiences.

My work focuses on:
- Product documentation
- User guides
- Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)
- Technical and documentation-style articles
- Internal documents such as memos
- Accessibility statements

I enjoy translating complex information into content that is easy to understand, accessible, and useful for end users and stakeholders.
